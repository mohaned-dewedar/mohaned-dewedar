# 👋 Hey, I’m Moe  

**CS Master’s Student (OMSCS) · Interested in ML/AI**  

I work mainly with Python and JavaScript, building systems with tools like Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit, and Gradio.  

At Georgia Tech, I’m studying **Bayesian Statistics** and **Operating Systems**. I’ve completed several OMSCS courses and am exploring whether to focus more on **systems** (HPC, distributed systems, GPU, OS) or **AI** (RL, NLP).
