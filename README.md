# 👋 Hey, I’m Moe  

**Aspiring ML/AI Engineer · OMSCS Master’s Student**  

I build AI-driven apps — from quick proof-of-concepts to production-ready systems. My main playground is **Python** (Flask / FastAPI) + a bit of JS for the front end, and I use **Streamlit** or **Gradio** when I want to spin up something fast.  

Right now, I’m diving deep into **Bayesian Statistics** and **Operating Systems** at Georgia Tech, and I’ve already taken 4 OMSCS courses. Next up, I’m eyeing **High Performance Computing**, **Distributed Systems**, **Advanced OS**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **NLP**, and maybe even **GPU Programming**.

## 🔥 What I’m Working On  
- **🎮 Twitch x AI Smite Bot** – A chatbot that uses RAG to answer Smite questions and trivia, with a leaderboard system coming soon so other streamers can use it.  
- **📍 Player Coordinate Prediction** – Exploring models to predict player positions from game state data (hard part: actually gathering that data).  

---

## 💡 Stuff I’ve Done Before  
- Built chatbots, RAG pipelines, Q&A systems, and agent workflows.  
- Worked on image annotation tools, business-rule-to-JSON converters, and various ML prototypes.  
- Plenty of mechatronics/robotics projects back in undergrad — from UAVs to machine vision arms.
