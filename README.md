# 👋 Hey, I’m Moe  

**Aspiring ML/AI Engineer · OMSCS Master’s Student**  

I build AI-driven apps, from quick prototypes to production-ready systems using Python (Flask, FastAPI), JS, and rapid tools like Streamlit or Gradio.
Right now, I’m diving deep into **Bayesian Statistics** and **Operating Systems** at Georgia Tech, and I’ve already taken 4 OMSCS courses. Next up, I’m eyeing Systems (HPC, Distributed, OS, GPU) vs. AI (RL, NLP).

## 🔥Fun Projects I’m Working On  
- **🎮 Twitch x AI Smite Bot** – A chatbot that uses RAG to answer Smite questions and trivia, with a leaderboard system coming soon so other streamers can use it.  
- **📍 Player Coordinate Prediction** – Exploring models to predict player positions from game state data (hard part: actually gathering that data).  

---

## 💡 Stuff I’ve Done Before  
- Built chatbots, RAG pipelines, Q&A systems, and agent workflows.  
- Worked on image annotation tools, business-rule-to-JSON converters, and various ML prototypes.  
- Plenty of mechatronics/robotics projects back in undergrad from circuits to robots.
